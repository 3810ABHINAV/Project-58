  <p>The series takes place at the Gokuldham Co-operative Housing Society – an apartment complex in Powder Gali, Goregaon East, Film City road, Mumbai – and centres around the members of Gokuldham Society. The residents of Gokuldham are shown facing mundane problems and finding solutions for those problems. The show also occasionally highlights social issues. Most of the episodes are based on Jethalal being stuck in a problem and Taarak Mehta, his best friend, whom he calls his "Fire Brigade", rescues him. They help each other in their problems, to promote unity in diversity. Gokuldham is lively and often laughs. The members of Gokuldham celebrate all the festivals like a family and organise various events. The responsibility of organising these events is often on Tapu Sena's shoulders while Bhide is tensed about exceeding the budget.
